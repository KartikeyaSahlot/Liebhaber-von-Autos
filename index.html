                  <h6 class="u-text u-text-2"> Rolls
Royce produces one of the world’s most luxurious cars. Known for producing hand
crafted automobiles that promise a seamless “magical carpet ride” for its
customers. The Black Badge is for those who reject conformity and live on their
own terms. It’s for the innovators, trailblazers, rule-breakers — and above all
— those who dare. Black Badge is an
audacious alter ego, designed with a trim level that adds more luxury, power,
improved handling and a darkened aesthetic. Rolls-Royce will introduce their first-ever ghost black badge in 2022, which
is named after the largest diamond that has ever been found on earth.<br>
                    <br><b><u>Specifications:</u></b> The new Rolls Royce has 591 horsepower. It takes 4.5 seconds
for the car to reach from 0-100 km/h. There is 45 kg paint on the rolls Royce.
A Rolls Royce is coated at least 7 times. The black badge has a typical design
of a Rolls Royce ghost. The rolls Royce has another exquisite accessory which
is nowhere to be seen on any other car. On all 4 tires of the car the logo of
rolls Royce embedded on the centre of the tire does not rotate with the wheel
and the also the spirit of ecstasy ornament. Tires have 21-inch rims with 44
layers of carbon fibre.<br>

                    <br><b><u>Fun Fact:</u></b> BMW approached rolls Royce and paid $65 million to acquire
the rights to the name, symbol and the spirit of ecstasy. The best part of the
car is that there is no specific base price for any rolls Royce and all the
prices completely depends on the modifications made by the customer. Another
shining feature of the Royce is the Starlight headliner, an intricate series of
fibre-optic roof lights that recreate the night sky with 1,340 individual stars
which makes the ceiling of the Royce worth $17,000. This car has an Infiniti
logo which determines that there can be infinite modifications done in the car.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br><b><u>Insulation:</u></b> To create a virtually silent ride rolls Royce adds
approximately 136 kilograms of acoustic insulation around the cabin. The tires
are modified and foam is added to the insides of the tire which reduces 9db of
the road.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br><b><u>Conclusion:</u></b> With a price of $484,950.
All these marvellous features make the car irresistible and worth buying.

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b><u>Introduction:</u></b> We all know about the Tesla Cybertruck fail but this shadowed
the uniqueness and the specialty of the truck. Tesla’s first pickup truck is
most likely to be a more prominent sign in 2021.&nbsp;<br><b><u>Specifications:</u></b> With an abnormal shape
and dystopian design this truck aims revolutionize the way people drive motor
vehicles. With an immense horsepower of 800hp this truck moves like a
Lamborghini and tows like a freightliner. It has a top speed of 110 mph or 390
km/h and a towing capacity of 14,000 pounds or 6350 kgs. The truck can go from
0-100 km/h in 2.9 seconds. The advanced exo-skeleton is made up of stainless
steel which can withstand hot and freezing temperatures and this material is
also used in spacecrafts. This makes the truck sturdier and more damage
resistant than other trucks which means the truck is very safe. All tesla cars
have a unique interior styling and the cybertruck is no exception. The black
dashboard and small steering wheel coupled with the tablet gives the truck the
trademark tesla aesthetic.

                      <h6 class="u-text u-text-body-color u-text-default-lg u-text-default-xl u-text-3"><b><u>Safety:</u></b> We have discussed how sturdy and strong the exo skeleton of
the car is, all this makes the truck bulletproof and the truck can withstand
9mm of ammunition which involves handguns and machine guns. <br><b><u>Fun Fact: </u></b> In addition to all these features the tesla cybertruck can
also act as a boat for short distances and can float on water. As the truck is
electric there is no intake or exhaust so there will be no damage to the truck
by water. The truck also has a vault, made by the same stainless steel as the
exterior it suffers no intrusions from the wheel which gives a flat and clean
rectangular surface. The tailgate opens in the form of a ramp for vehicles like
ATV’s to roll up into the vault with ease. This vault also has a cover that can
rolled up which helps the car achieve higher aerodynamic efficiency. Another
stunning feature is that the truck can go 402 km with a single charge. Tesla
has plans to extend its supercharging stations to make recharging much easier
and accessible to the public.&nbsp;<br><b><u>Conclusion:</u></b> This model may lack in visual beauty but it makes up for it
with the ultra-modern technology. The cybertruck is equipped with a 17-inch
display tablet which is similar to the tablet in the tesla model X and S.
According to the manufacturers the interface of the cybertruck will be tailored
to specifically for truck users. With all these loaded features and advanced
technology, the truck has currently 1 million eager customers who have
pre-ordered this technological marvel.
